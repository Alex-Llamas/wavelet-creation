The objective of this paper is to present a new technique for the calculation
of the coecients required for a Wavelet Multiresolution Analysis (WMA).
When we perform a WMA we take a mother wavelet and find out how the
scales and translations of the wavelet best describe the signal. The result
of the analysis is a matrix that contains the weight for each scale and time
instant. To perform the analysis we use a two filter bank, a low pass filter
form with the scaling coefficients and a high pass filter form with the wavelet
coefficients. Our proposal focuses on finding the scaling and wavelet coef-
ficients based on a given function by solving an optimization problem with
nonlinear restrictions.
